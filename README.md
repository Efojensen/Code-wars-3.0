# Code-wars-3.0
The next assignment
Another mission from the coding masters. It seems they keep giving me easier and easier tasks to accomplish
because it seems I can't run my codes in their online editor. I always keep getting errors while it works fine in Vs code.
I think I've to go and inquire as to what's going on. But alls well that ends well. Should the same assignment pop up again, I could just link them to this 
repository and save myself a lot of time and energy.
The task this time was to return the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 below a certain number.
Looking at this the answer already came to me in both python and C++ but I decided to go the C++ route because now a days instead of me to think cout,
I think print. 
I used the modulus operator and the or conditional to cipher through all the numbers below the number inputed and return the ones divisible by 3 and 5.
Then, I saved their sum to a variable and outputted them. It's really a beginner challenge and almost any one who's learnt programming, and not coding would be able to
solve it by just looking at it.
Anyway this is it. I'm gonna stop using C++ and python for now since I seem to be getting the hang of them. The next assignment will be solved in Javascript.
Well, gotta go back to studying and all since I'm still in the end of sem period.(Shocker)
I really hope to be at the level I envision myself to be in the next year.
Go beyond...Plus Ultra!!!
